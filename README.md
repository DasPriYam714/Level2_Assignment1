Problem 1: 


One of the most powerful features of TypeScript is declaration merging. This allows us to define an interface in one place, and extend it later by redefining it with additional properties. like

interface User {
  name: string;
}

interface User {
  age: number;
}
 which is not possible in type aliases

So ff we are working in a large codebase or extending types across modules/libraries, interfaces give us more flexibility and less friction.
While interfaces are great for defining the shape of objects, type aliases can describe primitives, unions, intersections, tuples.


Problem 5:

In the fast-paced world of software development, writing clean, reliable, and maintainable code isn’t just a luxury—it’s a necessity. That’s where TypeScript shines.

More than just a superset of JavaScript, TypeScript is a developer's ally in building robust, scalable applications.

Static Typing: JavaScript is flexible—and that’s part of the problem. We might accidentally pass a string where a number is expected, or access a property on undefined. These bugs can be hard to trace and often show up only at runtime.

Improved Maintainability: In larger codebases, understanding how components interact becomes harder. Without clear documentation, developers spend time guessing what a function expects—or worse, introducing regressions. As a application grows, these contracts serve as self-documenting code, making onboarding new developers faster and preventing unintended changes from breaking functionality.
